# Generation-of-Video-Descriptions-with-an-NLG-Approach
Complete ML pipelibe to automatically generate a textual and a video review of a product given its features (e.g. RAM, size, ...)


Using GPT-2 medium, we developed a natural language generation (NLG) pipeline that takes a list of product features as input and generates a text description of the product. The output text is then used to automatically create a video-slideshow of the product, with a text-to-speech (TTS) system reading the textual review. 
In addition to developing an NLG pipeline for product descriptions, we conducted a thorough contextual analysis which included evaluating end users, stakeholders, personas, and the potential impact of implementing the solution in real-world settings. We also considered the project's alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This project demonstrates not only the technical capabilities of NLG and automated video creation, but also the importance of considering the broader context and potential impacts of such solutions.

This project was done for the Applied Data Science Project course, held by prof. Giuseppe Rizzo.
It was proposed by the company FlowyGo, and we worked under the supervision of prof. Alessandro Fiori
It was done in collaboration with my fellow collegues:
- Luca Agnese
- Matteo Donadio
- Qu Tianming
- Jiahao Zhang

Our work was based on the Master Thesis of Andrea Avignone, who gave as a baseline code and greatly helped us in facing the various challanges that arised. Given that the Theses' work is currently publishing, parts of the code for this project won't be available

Togheter with part of the code, in the repository could be found:
- the slides to support our 3 intermediate and the final presentations
- a report detailing out project, so to contestualize it, explain it and compare it with the current literature
