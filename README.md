# Generation-of-Video-Descriptions-with-an-NLG-Approach
Complete ML pipeline to automatically generate a textual and a video review of a product given its features (e.g. RAM, size, ...)


Using GPT-2 medium, we developed a natural language generation (NLG) pipeline that takes a list of product features as input and generates a text description of the product. The output text is then used to automatically create a video-slideshow of the product, with a text-to-speech system reading the textual review. 
In addition, we conducted a contextual analysis that included a review of end users, stakeholders, personas, and the potential impact of implementing the solution in real-world settings. We also considered the project's alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This project demonstrates not only the technical capabilities of NLG and automated video creation, but also the importance of considering the broader context and potential impacts of such solutions.

This project was undertaken as part of the Applied Data Science Project course, taught by prof. [Giuseppe Rizzo](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=giuseppe.rizzo).
It was proposed by the company [FlowyGo](https://flowygo.com/en/homepage/), and we worked under the supervision of prof. [Alessandro Fiori](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=alessandro.fiori)
 The project was a collaborative effort with my colleagues:
- Luca Agnese
- Matteo Donadio
- Qu Tianming
- Jiahao Zhang

Our work was based on the Master Thesis of Andrea Avignone, who gave as a baseline code and greatly helped us in facing the various challanges that arised.

Togheter with the code, in the repository could be found:
- the slides from our 3 intermediate presentations  and the final presentation
- a report detailing out project, so to contestualize it, explain it and compare it with the current literature
