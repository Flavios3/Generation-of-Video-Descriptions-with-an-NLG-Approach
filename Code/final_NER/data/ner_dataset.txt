This lets consumers wash their clothes the old-fashioned, rough and tumble way, or the more modern, gentle approach. In our testing, we found wash cycles that used the agitator tended to be a bit rougher but did erase more stains compared to the impeller-based wash. The <prod>Whirlpool WTW8127LC</prod> is one of the best <attr>pole-agitator</attr> washers that we have ever tested, and it's our highest-scoring <attr>pole agitator</attr> to date. As with other Whirlpool washers, the <prod>Whirlpool WTW8127LC</prod> features the <attr>What to Wash / How to Wash \u009d system</attr>, which helps take the guesswork out of what a wash cycle does. We also liked its <attr>pre-treat features</attr>, and found the included <attr>detergent brush</attr> to be effective at scrubbing out stains.", "If you want a workhouse washer that can deal with lots of laundry and lots of different laundry situations, you'll want to take a look at the <prod>LG WT7900HBA</prod> top-loading washer. This washer has a lot of appealing features, including a <attr>5.5 cu. ft capacity</attr>, an <attr>Allergiene cycle</attr> (which claims to remove pet dander and dust mites), and <attr>seven steam cycles</attr> (including Normal, <attr>Allergiene cycle</attr>, and <attr>Sanitary</attr> ) .Additionally, the cycle times are nice and short. The Normal and <attr>Speed Wash cycles</attr> both clock in at 30 minutes long. If you really have some serious stains to remove, though, we recommend the <attr>Heavy Duty cycle</attr> , which performed the best in our stain removal tests, and takes less than two hours to run. While this washer isn't as efficient as some LG front-load washers we've tested, if you like top-load washers and want a larger tub capacity and fast cycle times, the <prod>LG WT7900HBA</prod> might be a good fit for you.", "Distinguished by its <attr>updated sensor design</attr>, the <prod>Sony Alpha a7 III Mirrorless Digital Camera</prod> is a well-rounded camera suitable for both photo and video applications in a variety of working situations. Refined for improved speed and low-light performance, the <attr>full-frame 24.2MP Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor</attr> and <attr>BIONZ X image processor</attr> pair to realize an impressive <attr>10 fps continuous shooting rate</attr> and improved autofocus performance for faster, more reliable subject tracking along with wide frame coverage. This updated <attr>Fast Hybrid AF System</attr> employs a combination of <attr>693 phase-detection points</attr> and <attr>425 contrast-detection areas</attr> for quicker acquirement of focus in a variety of lighting conditions, and also maintains focus on subjects more effectively. In addition to speed and AF, the processing improvements also help to realize <attr>greater image clarity</attr> and <attr>reduced noise</attr> throughout the sensitivity range from <attr>ISO 100-51200</attr>, which can further be expanded to <attr>ISO 50-204800</attr>. Video recording capabilities have also been extended for enhanced quality when recording <attr>UHD 4K video</attr> with the full width of the full-frame sensor to minimize moire and aliasing. Additionally, benefitting both stills and video operation, itI utilizes a <attr>5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift image stabilization</attr>, which is now effective to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to 5 stops. Beyond just updates to the imaging system, the body design has also been revised to include a <attr>rear 3.0' 922k-dot touchscreen LCD</attr>, which has a <attr>tilting design</attr> to better support working from high and low angles.

There are three ports: <attr>two USB-A</attr>, and a <attr>lone USB-C port</attr>. <attr>four Indicator lights</attr>, and a <attr>power button</attr>. The fabric material covering the top and bottom of the pack are a nice break from the usual plastic housing, although the edges of the pack are black plastic. The pack itself is roughly the same width and height as Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus: you'd need to stack three of those phones to approximate the pack's thickness. The pack's ports live on the front of the pack with the <attr>lone USB-C port</attr> between the two <attr>standard USB ports</attr>. The <attr>lone USB-C port</attr> is used to charge devices or charge the pack itself. It can put out <attr>5V/3A (15W)</attr> of power, while the <attr>standard USB ports</attr> are limited to <attr>5V/2.4A</attr> and <attr>5V/1A</attr>, respectively. The <prod>Powerstation XXL</prod> can charge at a <attr>maximum of 5V/3.4A</attr>, or roughly <attr>17W</attr>. It was able to charge the pack <attr>from empty to full in 5 hours and 6 minutes</attr>. As for efficiency, the <prod>Powerstation XXL</prod> is the third-most efficient pack I've tested overall at 92.51 percent. Included in the box with the <prod>Powerstation XXL</prod> is a <attr>USB-A to USB-C cord</attr> that's far too short, but appreciated nonetheless. On the left side of the pack is where you'll find the <attr>power button</attr> and <attr>four indicator lights</attr>. The lights are hard to see if you aren't looking at them straight on, and they don't stay on while the pack is charging to easily see its current status. I'd like to see improved visibility from multiple viewing angles and for the lights to remain on while charging. Overall, the <prod>Powerstation XXL</prod> does it all: save for wireless charging and is affordably priced. Even though it doesn't have charging cables built into it, its efficiency, speed at which it charges back up, and price point make it too good to pass up.", "For the last few weeks, I've been testing the $69.99 <prod>Einvova 63W Ultra-Fast Power Bank</prod> and, well, I'm very happy with it. Compared to the majority of power banks, which typically consist of black plastic housing with a power button and a few LED lights and some ports on one end, Einova's design stands out. The <prod>Einvova 63W Ultra-Fast Power Bank</prod> has a fabric covering on top and bottom, a <attr>small display</attr> on the top that shows the exact battery percentage, and three ports: <attr>two USB-A</attr> and <attr>one USB-C</attr>. The <attr>USB-C port</attr> pulls <attr>double duty</attr>. You use it to charge the pack, and you can, of course, use it to charge your phone, laptop, or even a Nintendo Switch. The <attr>USB-C port</attr> supports charging at up to <attr>20V/2.25A (45W) of output</attr>, and up to <attr>20V/1.5A (30W) of input</attr>. The middle <attr>USB port</attr> supports up to <attr>12V/1.5A (18W) of output</attr>, with the standard <attr>USB port</attr> offering the base charging speed of <attr>5V/2.4A (12W) of output</attr>. The middle <attr>USB port</attr> triggered the same charging standards and capped out at its listed <attr>maximum output of 18W</attr>. Finally, the last <attr>USB port</attr> triggered <attr>Apple 2.4A</attr>, <attr>DCP 1.5A</attr>, and <attr>Samsung 5V</attr>. Charging the pack was speedy, going <attr>from empty to 100 percent in 2 hours and 40 minutes</attr> when charging at its full <attr>30W max speed</attr>. You can use all three ports on the <prod>Einvova 63W Ultra-Fast Power Bank</prod> to charge various devices at the same time, with a <attr>maximum output between the three of 63W</attr>. There isn't a power button on the pack. You plug in a device, it detects something is there, and starts charging. And, finally, the pack does support <attr>passthrough charging</attr> so you can charge the pack via the <attr>USB-C port</attr> while simultaneously charging another device via either standard <attr>USB port</attr>. The <prod>Einvova 63W Ultra-Fast Power Bank</prod> is well designed, has plenty of power, and has above-average efficiency.", "<prod>Belkin BoostUp Charge Plus 10K</prod>, a <attr>10,000mAh (37Wh) battery</attr> pack that has <attr>two built-in cables</attr>: <attr>one USB-C</attr>, one <attr>Apple Lightning connector</attr>. The housing comes in the standard battery-pack color of black, or you can pick the blue color option that, to my eyes, looks almost purple (while the cables themselves remain black). On the front of the housing are <attr>four LED indicator lights</attr>, a <attr>USB-C port</attr>, and a <attr>power button</attr>. Each light represents 25 percent of the battery's capacity, while the <attr>USB-C port</attr> is used to charge the pack itself, or connect a cable of your own to it and provide up to <attr>18W of charging power</attr> in either direction. The <attr>built-in USB-C</attr> and <attr>Lightning cables</attr> are also capable of up to <attr>18W of charging power</attr>, but the pack has an <attr>overall limit of 23W</attr> if you're using more than one connection at a time. The pack supports <attr>passthrough charging</attr>, allowing you to charge the battery and a device (or devices) at the same time. You also don't have to turn the pack on in order for it to start charging your phone or tablet. I like Belkin's products, and that opinion doesn't change after using the <prod>Belkin BoostUp Charge Plus 10K</prod>. It's a reliable, if also slightly novel backup battery, that's on the high end of the price scale for a <attr>10,000mAh pack</attr>. However, the added benefit of integrated cables does mean you have one less thing to worry about when you're packing. For some, that's worth the added cost.", "<prod>RAVPower Portable Power Station 252.7Wh Power House</prod>, a $179 powerhouse that looks more like a portable speaker than something you'd plug a 110v gadget into, or that could power a lamp for 37:26 minutes. The package Included in the box with the power station is a <attr>soft carrying case</attr> for holding the station and the included <attr>110V DC charger</attr>. Using the <attr>110V DC charger</attr>, I was able to go <attr>from empty to full in 6 hours and 23 minutes</attr>, or 23 minutes longer than RAVPower's published estimate. Alternatively, you can charge the station using a <attr>60W PD adapter</attr> through the <attr>USB-C port</attr>, which should charge the station in just under 5 hours. As its name implies, this power station has a <attr>total capacity of 252.7Wh</attr>, or <attr>70,200mAh</attr>. To put that into perspective, the current iPhone 12 Pro has a battery capacity of 2,815mAh. The tall, cube-like <attr>design is all black</attr>, with a <attr>handle on the top</attr>. There are <attr>feet on the bottom</attr> of the station that hold it off the ground slightly, but also prevent it from slipping off a smooth surface. Buttons and ports are distributed among the station's four sides: on one side, <attr>indicator light</attr> reveal the station's charge level; another side has the <attr>power button</attr> and a <attr>flashlight</attr>; the third has <attr>two DC ports</attr>; and the fourth side has <attr>three USB ports</attr> and a <attr>lone USB-C PD port</attr>. On the top of the housing, you'll find <attr>two 2-prong 110V outlets</attr>, along with a <attr>power button</attr> and another <attr>indicator light</attr>. Two of the <attr>three USB ports</attr> <attr>max out at 12W total</attr>, while the third one, and you'll know which one it is because it's green, is capable of <attr>18W max output</attr>. The <attr>USB-C port</attr> can accept or dish out up to 60W of power, and for any of the ports, you don't need to turn on the power station first. Just plug in your USB cable, connect your phone or tablet (or what have you), and it'll start charging. Using the 110V outlets works a little differently. You can get <attr>250W from a single outlet</attr>; if you use both outlets, you'll <attr>max out at 300W</attr>. Before the <attr>AC outlets</attr> are active, you'll need to press and hold the small button between the two outlets until the <attr>indicator light</attr> turns on. Now plug in something like a lamp or laptop charger (as long as it doesn't have a three-prong ground plug). Overall, the <prod>RAVPower Portable Power Station 252.7Wh Power House</prod> punches above its weight. It's one of the most affordable <attr>power stations</attr> I've tested, and it performed very well. The inclusion of a bag to carry it, a <attr>6 hour charging time</attr> and a high efficiency make it perfect to toss in the trunk of your car for a weekend camping trip or keep charged in your hallway cabinet for the occasional power outage. If nothing else, you'll be able to keep your phones and tablets charged and yourself entertained until service returns.", "The <prod>PowerAdd Slim 2</prod> is as basic as power banks get, with just a <attr>micro-USB input</attr>, a <attr>USB-A output</attr> and no support for any fast-charging standards. What's more, it's slow. The <attr>USB-A output</attr> is specified as <attr>10W</attr>, but in our tests we measured the output at between 7W and 9W depending on the phone. A 15-minute charge only raised the level on our test smartphone by 7%. However, the <prod>PowerAdd Slim 2</prod> has three things going for it. It's nice and small, at just <attr>10.5cm long</attr>, with a tube shape that fits easily into a pocket, bag or handbag. It's also cheap: you can pick one up for \u20ac15. Most of all, the design has proved <attr>rock-solid</attr> and reliable, and we have one that's still going strong after a couple of years of on and off use. You won't get anything more than you pay for, but it's a <attr>budget power bank</attr> that does the job.", "Calling this compact power bank a <attr>three-charge model</attr> would have made sense in the days when flagship smartphones had a 3,500mAh battery, but is probably pushing it in an era of 4,800mAh monster phones. That aside, though, this is a great little power bank, small and light enough to be <attr>easily pocketable</attr>, but with enough charge to get you through a weekend away. You can charge it through <attr>micro-USB or USB-C</attr>, with the <attr>USB-C input</attr> squirreled away on the side, and you can even charge two devices simultaneously. It's not a fast charger, by any means. We measured the <attr>USB-A output at 8.85W</attr> and the <attr>USB-C at 9.85W</attr>, which was enough to recharge our test smartphone by just 11% and 13% respectively in 15 minutes. However, we love the <attr>tough, slightly rubberized casing</attr>, the <attr>digital capacity display</attr> and the fact that it comes in a range of colors. If you're looking for a small power bank to recharge with while you're out and about, the <prod>Juice 3 Charger</prod> is a great option.", "The <prod>Zendure SuperMini 20W</prod> is the total package when it comes to charging a smartphone or other small electronic device while on the go. It's compact and lightweight: around the <attr>size of a deck of cards</attr> and as heavy as an iPhone 13. Yet its capacity rating is as high as any of our other picks. If you want a power bank that you can easily slip into a pocket or purse as you walk out the door but that still contains enough juice to charge most smartphones up to three times, this is the one to get. The <prod>Zendure SuperMini 20W</prod> has a port on each end: <attr>a USB-C PD port</attr> on one side that works for both output and input (meaning it's how you recharge the power bank itself), and a standard <attr>output-only USB-A port</attr> on the other. In our tests, we measured a <attr>maximum output of 18.6 watts</attr> and a <attr>maximum input of 19.3 watts</attr> from the <attr>USB-C port</attr>, and a <attr>maximum output of 16.6 watts</attr> from the <attr>output-only USB-A port</attr>. While those numbers fall a little short of its <attr>20 W output rating</attr>, the <prod>Zendure SuperMini 20W</prod> is still powerful enough to charge most devices at top speed from either port, or to <attr>charge two devices simultaneously</attr> at slightly slower speeds. With a <attr>capacity rating of 10,000 mAh</attr>, you can fully charge your phone up to three times. The exterior of the <prod>Zendure SuperMini 20W</prod> is a <attr>hard, shiny, plastic shell</attr> that's <attr>relatively resistant to scuffs and scratches</attr>. It comes in a variety of colors (red, green, black, silver, blue, and pink) and, measuring just <attr>3.1 x 2.2 x 1 inches</attr>, fits in the palm of your hand. It <attr>weighs 6.4 ounces</attr> which is about as much as a hockey puck, which is lighter than any other 10,000 mAh power bank we tested. The SuperMini unit is backed by Zendure's <attr>two-year warranty</attr> which is longer than that of any of our other picks and which should give you plenty of time to test it out and ensure you don't have a dud. We've also had good experiences with <attr>Zendure's customer support</attr> in the more than five years we've been reviewing its products.", "You might be tempted by the $899 <prod>Frigidaire Gallery 30-Inch Electric Range</prod>.

We also like <attr>LG's smart diagnosis</attr> feature that transmits data via your phone directly to <attr>LG Customer Information Center</attr> to troubleshoot without stress. Though, it did take a few tries to get connected to the app during testing. In our testing, we found that the <attr>balanced cooktop</attr> provided <attr>even heat distribution</attr>, <attr>boiled water quickly</attr> and <attr>kept water at a constant simmer</attr>.

It's a <attr>super tank model</attr>, meaning it has a refillable ink tank instead of cartridges. A set of ink yields thousands of prints, and <attr>replacement ink</attr> is cheap, so you don't need to worry about high maintenance costs. It takes about 50 seconds to print a 4'' x 6'' photo on glossy paper, and it supports <attr>paper sizes up to 13'' x 19''</attr>, which is great for making posters. To be clear, this is a <attr>photo printer</attr> first, so if you only plan on printing documents, you can easily find cheaper models that can do it just as well, like the mid-range picks we have below. This model also lacks features like an automatic document feeder and duplex scanning, though it does produce amazing scans. You can connect to the printer via <attr>Wi-Fi</attr>, USB, or <attr>Ethernet</attr> and can print directly from an <attr>SD card</attr>.", "The company's new Pixma TS-series replaces the MG-series, but at heart, they remain the same: <attr>all-in-one inkjet printer</attr> for the home and serve the same customer. In this <prod>Canon Pixma TS9020</prod> review, we take a look at the flagship model: a <attr>six-color multifunction printer</attr> that prints, scans, and copies, with the bonus of producing excellent quality <attr>photo output up to 8x10 inches</attr>. With the <prod>Canon Pixma TS9020</prod>, Canon has redesigned the look of its consumer inkjet models: less curvy, and boxier. We know taste is subjective, but we find the compact all-in-one (<attr>14.7 x 12.8 x 5.6 inches</attr>; <attr>15 pounds</attr>) sleek, with its two-tone, glossy black and white exterior (it's also available in red). Lift the white lid to reveal the flatbed scanner.", "Our former top pick has been upgraded to the <prod>Rowenta DW5280 Focus</prod>, and although it wasn't as strong a contender this time around as the previous model, it's still an excellent iron for <attr>heavy-duty ironing</attr>. Of the four new irons we tested for this 2022 update, the <prod>Rowenta DW5280 Focus</prod> was by far the easiest to fill. The iron was designed to be filled lying horizontally, and the <attr>extra-wide water-filling inlet</attr> makes it a breeze, whether filling with a cup or simply straight out of the faucet. It was also easy to see the maximum fill line since the water tank is see-through. This model has a <attr>laser-etched stainless-steel soleplate</attr> with Rowenta's patented <attr>Precision Tip</attr> for getting into corners and buttonholes. Most impressive is its <attr>steam burst</attr>, which was the most powerful of the other irons tested and most effective at steaming wrinkles before and during ironing. The <prod>Rowenta DW5280 Focus</prod> has an <attr>even steam dispersion</attr> but it didn't seem to emit much steam, so we used the <attr>steam burst</attr> throughout. The iron has a very <attr>fine spray mist</attr> that doesn't spit and spatter, but although the Rowenta doesn't leak, droplets occasionally drip out of the spray hole. The <prod>Rowenta DW5280 Focus</prod> heats up to the <attr>maximum temperature in a minute</attr>, and when it hits the desired temperature, an <attr>orange preheating light</attr> goes out. The solidly constructed iron has a good weight so we didn't need to press heavily or redo areas. Overall, as with the previous model, the <prod>Rowenta DW5280 Focus</prod> relieves the burden of ironing and helps you get it done faster.", "Another worthy alternative is the <prod>Singer SteamLogic Plus 770</prod>. This steam iron does have a couple of quirks, but overall it has more pluses than minuses. The <prod>Singer SteamLogic Plus 770</prod> has a <attr>horseshoe-shaped ring of LED lights</attr> for <attr>four levels of heat</attr> that light up when the <attr>touchscreen power button</attr> is pressed. It hits the <attr>maximum temperature in one minute</attr>, the ready alert beeps and the LED ceases flashing when the iron is hot enough. <prod>Singer SteamLogic Plus 770</prod> is easy to <attr>fill horizontally</attr> with the included <attr>well-designed pitcher</attr>, but like the Mueller, it's hard to see the water level because of the <attr>dark gray water tank</attr>. When standing vertically, the <prod>Singer SteamLogic Plus 770</prod> steam burst is unimpressive, but when holding it horizontally while ironing, the burst is strong. It also had <attr>excellent steam dispersion</attr>, and wrinkles were ironed out in a single pass. The Singer is <attr>leak-proof</attr> but now and then a drop would emit from the spray. This steam iron has an <attr>extra long 12-foot cord</attr> but has no internal storage. Although the long cord was great for maneuvering around the ironing board, there is the issue of wrapping it up for storing the iron. The <prod>Singer SteamLogic Plus 770</prod> has good weight without being too heavy and doesn't require much pressing down. It doesn't have a precision tip, so it wasn't good with corners and buttons, but generally, the Singer had very <attr>good glide ability</attr> and coverage.", "<prod>Oliso Pro TG1600 Smart Iron</prod> deserves special mention as an iron designed for creative types. It's the most high-tech and forward-thinking of all the finalists with its unique innovations. Its construction and engineering are high-quality and well-executed. Its most unique feature is its <attr>iTouch Technology</attr>, which enables touch sensors to mechanically lift the iron when not in use to prevent the burning and scorching of fabrics. With crafters and creators at the forefront, this feature is wonderful for those who need to multi-task and or work with sensitive fabrics. It works surprisingly well, speaking to its overall high-quality design. In a line-up, it has a <attr>stands out soleplate design</attr>. While stainless steel is notorious for sticking to crafting materials like transfers, <prod>Oliso Pro TG1600 Smart Iron</prod> overcomes this shortcoming by adding a textured surface. <prod>Oliso Pro TG1600 Smart Iron</prod> unique <attr>stainless steel soleplate</attr> gives us the advantages of both stainless steel and ceramic without their drawbacks."]
